### Current challenge requisites

 Challenge: MVVM and flow

* Adopt MVVM presentation pattern. Move all logic (add, edit, remove) to a ViewModel class.
* Create a Flow on the ViewModel class to take care of the list (as per good practices, a private mutable and a public non mutable, so the View cannot alter it unless through ViewModel's public methods)
* Since we're dealing with Strings so far, there's no need to create a Model
